# ECoG_Manchester
ECoG analysis - data from Professor Matt Lambon Ralph

ECoG were recorded while the participants were viewing images of animate versus inanimate objects. Here's the accuracy curve for the animacy classification accuracy (with logistic lasso) over time, based on their ECoG recording, averaged across participants. In contrary to some exisiting findings, the significance of the classification accuracy is rather persistent.
